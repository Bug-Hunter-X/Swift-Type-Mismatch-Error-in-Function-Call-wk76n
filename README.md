# Swift Type Mismatch Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Swift: passing incorrect argument types to a function.

The `bug.swift` file contains code that attempts to pass String values to a function expecting Double values, resulting in a compiler error.

The `bugSolution.swift` file shows the corrected code, where the String values are explicitly converted to Doubles before being passed to the function.
